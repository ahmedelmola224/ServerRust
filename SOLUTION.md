# Solution

Original Code:  
Operated in a blocking manner, processing one client at a time before moving on. This design severely limited scalability.

New Code:  
Implements concurrency by using a thread pool to handle multiple client connections.  
Each incoming connection is assigned to a worker thread from the thread pool, avoiding the overhead of spawning a new thread for every connection.  
Ensures efficient resource usage and improved scalability.

Original Code:  
Worked only with EchoMessage and lacked flexibility to extend for additional message types.

New Code:  
Introduces ClientMessage and ServerMessage structures to support multiple message types.  
Adds the following message types:  
- EchoMessage: Echoes back the received content.  
- AddRequest: Computes the sum of two integers and responds with an AddResponse.  
This modular approach makes the server extensible for future features.

Original Code:  
Read and processed a single message before closing the connection, requiring clients to reconnect for subsequent interactions.

New Code:  
Continuously reads and processes messages in a loop until the client disconnects or an error occurs.  
This enables multiple interactions over a single connection.

Original Code:  
Relied on blocking I/O, risking indefinite hangs when waiting for input.

New Code:  
Implements non-blocking I/O with error handling for ErrorKind::WouldBlock.  
Introduces a brief delay (thread::sleep) before retrying, preventing busy-wait loops.

I added three test cases:  
1. Handling Negative Numbers: A test case was added to ensure the server can correctly handle the addition of negative numbers.  
2. High Traffic Handling: A test case was added to simulate sending a large number of messages to the server.  
3. Post-Disconnection Message Handling: Another test was introduced to verify the server's behavior when attempting to send messages after a client has disconnected.

To address potential issues in test case execution, I added the serial_test crate. In the original implementation, all test cases would run simultaneously, which created conflicts because each test tried to use the server on the same portâ€”a shared resource. To prevent these conflicts, I used the #[serial] attribute in the test cases. This ensures that tests are executed one at a time, allowing the server to be accessed in a controlled manner without interference between tests.
